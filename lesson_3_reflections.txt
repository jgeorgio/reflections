Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Most likely in the scenario where more then one person is collaborating on a specific project. Also, from a risk management and redundancy perspective, I would prefer to have a backup copy of my git project on the cloud.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: When working on a project with other collaborators, automatically pulling remotes to my local repository can lead to undesired results when developing. Manual pulling allows us to review the changes on the remote first before we decide we want to pull them.


Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: The difference between forks and clones is that the former are closely tied to GitHub servers. You can have a repository clone between a GitHub server and local machine or even just on the local machine. Branches on the other hand are found within a repository and are made up of commits.


Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: One of the benefits are if we're planning to work offline, this would allow us to view the most recent changes that were made to the project by other collaborators (if any). Second, having a recent copy of the remote branch(es) helps us with viewing all collaborator changes without us having to merge the changes to our local copy branches.
